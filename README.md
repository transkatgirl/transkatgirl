## about me

### a girl learning to navigate the world.

when given multiple choices, i try to pick the most interesting one, and i would like to encourage others to do the same.

optimize for novelty, optimize for interestingness. live the life you want to live, as it's the only one you'll get.

### a girl with a vision.

i aim to leave the world better than i found it, by turning as many of my ideas into reality as i can.

you can just do things. reach heaven by violence, one star at a time.

## what i'm currently working on

- healing from a repetitive strain injury
- building software for self-guided learning
- exploring LLM base models
- exploring resilient communication protocols for a changing world
- telling my life story (and beginning its next chapter)
